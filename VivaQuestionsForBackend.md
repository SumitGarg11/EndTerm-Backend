#Introduction Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome, to execute code.
Node.js is designed to be fast and efficient, making it a popular choice for building web applications and backend services.

One of the key features of Node.js is its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, 
which allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. 
This makes it well-suited for building real-time web applications, such as chat applications or online gaming platforms.

Node.js also comes with a built-in package manager called npm (Node Package Manager), 
which makes it easy to install and manage third-party libraries and modules. 
This vast ecosystem of modules allows developers to quickly add functionality to their applications without having to write everything from scratch.

Overall, Node.js is a powerful and versatile platform that has revolutionized the way we build web applications,
particularly on the server-side. Its ease of use, performance, and rich ecosystem make it a popular choice for developers worldwide.



The event-driven, non-blocking I/O (Input/Output) model is a key feature of Node.js that allows it to efficiently handle multiple concurrent connections.
Here's a breakdown of these concepts:

1. **Event-Driven:** In an event-driven model, operations are based on events and event handlers.
2.  In Node.js, certain operations (such as reading a file or making a network request) are non-blocking,
3.  meaning they don't halt the execution of the program. Instead, Node.js continues to execute other tasks
4.  and registers a callback function to be executed when the operation completes. This allows Node.js to handle multiple operations concurrently.

5. **Non-Blocking I/O:** Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations to perform tasks asynchronously.
6. When an I/O operation is initiated, Node.js continues executing the rest of the program instead of waiting for the operation to complete.
7.  Once the I/O operation is finished, Node.js triggers the registered callback function to handle the result.

8. **Concurrent Connections:** Node.js is well-suited for handling a large number of concurrent connections because of its non-blocking nature.
9. Instead of creating a new thread for each connection (which can be resource-intensive),
10. Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to manage all connections.
11. This allows Node.js to scale efficiently and handle a large number of connections without requiring a significant amount of system resources.

To handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently in Node.js, you should follow these best practices:

- Use asynchronous operations: Whenever possible, use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Use streams: Node.js provides built-in support for streams, which allow you to process data as it's being read or written,
-  reducing memory usage and improving performance.
- Use clustering: Node.js includes a built-in cluster module that allows you to take advantage of multi-core systems by
- spawning multiple Node.js processes.
-  This can improve performance and scalability for applications that require heavy I/O operations.

Node Package Manager (npm) is a package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with Node.js.
It is the default package manager for Node.js, and it is used to install, manage, and share packages of JavaScript code.

**Why we use npm:**
- **Dependency management:** npm helps manage dependencies in Node.js projects by allowing developers to specify the packages their project depends on.
- **Package installation:** npm simplifies the process of installing packages by providing a command-line interface that can fetch and install packages from the npm registry.
- **Version management:** npm allows developers to specify the versions of packages their project depends on, ensuring that the project uses the correct versions of dependencies.
- **Code sharing:** npm makes it easy to share code with other developers by providing a centralized repository (npm registry) where packages can be published and accessed by others.

**How npm helps developers:**
- **Efficiency:** npm makes it easy to install and manage packages, reducing the time and effort required to set up a development environment.
- **Code reuse:** npm allows developers to easily reuse code by providing access to a wide range of packages and modules.
- **Community support:** npm has a large and active community of developers who contribute packages and provide support,
- making it easier for developers to find solutions to common problems.

**Internal working of npm:**
- **Registry:** npm uses a centralized registry to store packages. When a developer installs a package, npm fetches the package from the registry
-  and installs it in the project.
- **Package.json:** npm uses a `package.json` file to store metadata about the project and its dependencies.
-  This file is used to track dependencies and versions, making it easy to manage and share projects.
- **Dependency resolution:** When installing packages, npm resolves dependencies by checking the `package.json`
-  file and installing the specified versions of dependencies. It also installs any transitive dependencies required by the project.

Overall, npm is a powerful tool that helps developers manage dependencies,
share code, and collaborate with others, making it an essential part of the Node.js ecosystem.


Custom npm modules refer to packages or modules that you create yourself and publish to the npm registry for others to use.
These modules can contain reusable code, functions, or components that you want to share with the community or use across multiple projects.

Creating custom npm modules allows you to:

1. **Reusability:** Package commonly used code or functionality into modules that can be easily reused in multiple projects.
2. **Modularity:** Break down your codebase into smaller, more manageable modules, making it easier to maintain and update.
3. **Shareability:** Share your modules with others, either publicly on the npm registry or privately within your organization.
4. **Collaboration:** Collaborate with other developers by sharing and using each other's custom modules.

To create a custom npm module, you typically:

1. **Create the module:** Write the code for your module, including any functions, classes, or components you want to include.
2. **Initialize npm:** Use the `npm init` command to initialize a new npm package in your module's directory. This will create a `package.json` file.
3. **Publish the module:** Use the `npm publish` command to publish your module to the npm registry. If you're publishing a public module,
4. you'll need to create an npm account and login using the `npm login` command first.

Once your custom npm module is published, other developers can install it using the `npm install` command and use it in their projects.



To install Node.js on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js:** Visit the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the LTS (Long-Term Support)
2.  version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. **Install Node.js:** Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4.  On Windows, you can simply double-click the downloaded `.msi` file and follow the installation wizard.
5.   On macOS, you can open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the installation prompts.

6. **Verify Installation:** After the installation is complete,
7. open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to check if Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed:
8.
9.    node -v

10.
   This command will display the installed version of Node.js. Then, type the following command to check the installed version of npm
   
   npm -v
 

   This command will display the installed version of npm.

10. **Update npm (optional):** If you need to update npm to the latest version, you can do so by running the following command:

   ```sh
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

   This will update npm to the latest version globally (`-g` flag).

Node.js is now installed on your system, and you can start using it to run JavaScript applications and develop Node.js projects.

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. 
It's an interactive programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single expressions),
evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. REPLs are available in many programming languages, including Node.js.

#Features of the Node.js REPL:

 *   Tab completion: Pressing Tab will autocomplete variable names, object properties, and methods, making it easier to write code.
 *   Multiline input: You can input multiline expressions or functions by pressing Enter without completing the statement.
 *   The REPL will continue to the next line, denoted by ..., until you complete the expression.


Function Declaration:

function myFunction() {
  // Function body
}
Function Expression:
This assigns an anonymous function to a variable. It must be declared before it's called.

const myFunction = function() {
  // Function body
};
Arrow Function:

const myFunction = () => {
  // Function body
};

In JavaScript, objects are complex data types that allow you to store collections of key-value pairs. 
They are one of the most important and versatile features of the language. Here's a basic overview of 

Object Literal Syntax:

let person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
  greet: function() {
    return 'Hello!';
  }
};

Objects are defined using curly braces {}.
Each key-value pair in an object is separated by a colon :. Methods (functions) can also be defined as object properties

Accessing Object Properties:

console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30

You can access object properties using dot notation (objectName.propertyName) or bracket notation (objectName['propertyName']).

Adding and Modifying Properties:

person.city = 'New York'; // Add a new property
person.age = 31; // Modify an existing property

Nested Objects:

let student = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
  address: {
    city: 'London',
    country: 'UK'
  }
};
console.log(student.address.city); // Output: 'London'

Object Method

let car = {
  brand: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Camry',
  displayInfo: function() {
    return this.brand + ' ' + this.model;
  }
};
console.log(car.displayInfo()); // Output: 'Toyota Camry'

Objects can contain methods, which are functions defined as object properties. The this keyword refers to the current object.

#Object Constructor:

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
let person1 = new Person('Jane Doe', 35);

You can create objects using constructor functions, which are like blueprints for creating objects with specific properties and methods.
JavaScript objects are dynamic, meaning you can add or remove properties at runtime. 
They are versatile and widely used in JavaScript for representing data structures, organizing code, and modeling real-world entities.

The fs (file system) module in Node.js is a core module that provides an API for interacting with the file system.
It allows you to perform various file-related operations such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting files,
and managing file permissions. Here's an overview of how to work with the fs module:

Require the fs module:
To use the fs module, you first need to require it in your Node.js application:

const fs = require('fs');

Reading file

// Asynchronous file read
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Synchronous file read
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);

#Writing Files

// Asynchronous file write
fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello, World!', 'utf8', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File written successfully');
});

// Synchronous file write
fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello, World!', 'utf8');
console.log('File written successfully');

Other File Operations:

    Creating files: fs.open, fs.writeFile
    Deleting files: fs.unlink
    Renaming files: fs.rename
    Checking file existence: fs.existsSync
Working with Directories:

    Creating directories: fs.mkdir
    Reading directories: fs.readdir
    Removing directories: fs.rmdir
    
File Streams:
Node.js provides a way to handle files using streams, which allow you to read or write data in chunks. 
This can be more memory-efficient for large files:

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

File Permissions:
You can set or change file permissions using the fs.chmod method:

fs.chmod('example.txt', 0o755, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File permissions changed');
});

The Buffer module in Node.js is a global object that provides a way to work with binary data. 
It is used to handle raw binary data, such as reading and writing files, network operations, and other data-intensive tasks.
Here's an overview of the Buffer module and how to use it to buffer data:

Creating Buffers:
You can create a new buffer object using the Buffer.from() method or by calling the Buffer.alloc() method with the desired size:

const buffer1 = Buffer.from('Hello, World!', 'utf8');
const buffer2 = Buffer.alloc(10); // Creates a buffer of size 10

Reading from Buffers:
You can read data from a buffer using various methods like buffer.toString(), buffer.readUInt8(), etc.:

console.log(buffer1.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'Hello, World!'
console.log(buffer1.readUInt8(0)); // Output: 72 (ASCII value of 'H')

Writing to Buffers:

You can write data to a buffer using methods like buffer.write(), buffer.writeInt8(), etc.:

buffer2.write('Node.js'); // Writes 'Node.js' to buffer2
console.log(buffer2.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'Node.js'

Concatenating Buffers:
You can concatenate multiple buffers using the Buffer.concat() method:

const buffer3 = Buffer.concat([buffer1, buffer2]);
console.log(buffer3.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'Hello, World!Node.js'

Buffer Size and Manipulation:
You can get the size of a buffer using the buffer.length property and manipulate its contents using various methods:

console.log(buffer1.length); // Output: 13 (length of 'Hello, World!')
buffer1[0] = 104; // Changes the first character to 'h' (ASCII value of 'h')
console.log(buffer1.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'hello, World!'

Encoding and Decoding:

const encodedBuffer = Buffer.from('7468697320697320612074c3a97374', 'hex');
console.log(encodedBuffer.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'this is a tést'

The `Buffer` module in Node.js is a global object that provides a way to work with binary data. It is used to handle raw binary data, such as reading and writing files, network operations, and other data-intensive tasks. Here's an overview of the `Buffer` module and how to use it to buffer data:

1. **Creating Buffers:**
   You can create a new buffer object using the `Buffer.from()` method or by calling the `Buffer.alloc()` method with the desired size:
   ```javascript
   const buffer1 = Buffer.from('Hello, World!', 'utf8');
   const buffer2 = Buffer.alloc(10); // Creates a buffer of size 10
   ```

2. **Reading from Buffers:**
   You can read data from a buffer using various methods like `buffer.toString()`, `buffer.readUInt8()`, etc.:
   ```javascript
   console.log(buffer1.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'Hello, World!'
   console.log(buffer1.readUInt8(0)); // Output: 72 (ASCII value of 'H')
   ```

3. **Writing to Buffers:**
   You can write data to a buffer using methods like `buffer.write()`, `buffer.writeInt8()`, etc.:
   ```javascript
   buffer2.write('Node.js'); // Writes 'Node.js' to buffer2
   console.log(buffer2.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'Node.js'
   ```

4. **Concatenating Buffers:**
   You can concatenate multiple buffers using the `Buffer.concat()` method:
   ```javascript
   const buffer3 = Buffer.concat([buffer1, buffer2]);
   console.log(buffer3.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'Hello, World!Node.js'
   ```

5. **Buffer Size and Manipulation:**
   You can get the size of a buffer using the `buffer.length` property and manipulate its contents using various methods:
   ```javascript
   console.log(buffer1.length); // Output: 13 (length of 'Hello, World!')
   buffer1[0] = 104; // Changes the first character to 'h' (ASCII value of 'h')
   console.log(buffer1.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'hello, World!'
   ```

6. **Encoding and Decoding:**
   When working with buffers, you need to specify the encoding (e.g., `'utf8'`, `'hex'`, `'base64'`) to correctly interpret the data:
   ```javascript
   const encodedBuffer = Buffer.from('7468697320697320612074c3a97374', 'hex');
   console.log(encodedBuffer.toString('utf8')); // Output: 'this is a tést'
   ```

The `Buffer` module is useful for handling binary data in Node.js,
but it's important to note that direct manipulation of buffers can be error-prone,
especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters or multi-byte encodings.
Careful handling and encoding/decoding practices should be followed to ensure data integrity and security.

  zlib module provides functionality for compressing and decompressing data using the zlib compression library. 

 Compressing Data:
To compress data, you can use the zlib.deflate() method.
This method takes a buffer containing the data to be compressed and returns a new buffer containing the compressed data

const zlib = require('zlib');
const dataToCompress = Buffer.from('Hello, World!', 'utf8');
zlib.deflate(dataToCompress, (err, compressedData) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(compressedData.toString('base64'));
});

Decompressing Data:
To decompress data, you can use the zlib.inflate() method.
This method takes a buffer containing the compressed data and returns a new buffer containing the decompressed data


const compressedData = Buffer.from('eJzLSM3JyQcABiwCFQ==', 'base64');
zlib.inflate(compressedData, (err, decompressedData) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(decompressedData.toString('utf8'));
});

Compressing and Decompressing Streams:
You can also compress and decompress data streams using the zlib.createGzip() and zlib.createGunzip() methods, respectively.
These methods return transform streams that can be piped to and from other streams

const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt.gz');
readStream.pipe(zlib.createGzip()).pipe(writeStream);

// Decompressing
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('output.txt.gz');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('decompressed.txt');
readStream.pipe(zlib.createGunzip()).pipe(writeStream);

The http module in Node.js provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and making HTTP requests. 
It allows you to build web servers and interact with web services using the HTTP protocol. Here's an overview of how the http module works

const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});
server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});

Making HTTP Requests:

You can make HTTP requests to other servers using the http.request() method.
This method takes an options object specifying the request details, and a callback function that is called when the response is received

const http = require('http');
const options = {
  hostname: 'www.example.com',
  port: 80,
  path: '/',
  method: 'GET'
};
const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
  console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
  console.log(`HEADERS: ${JSON.stringify(res.headers)}`);
  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(`BODY: ${chunk}`);
  });
  res.on('end', () => {
    console.log('No more data in response.');
  });
});
req.end();

Handling HTTP Requests and Responses:
In the request listener function for an HTTP server, you can access information about the incoming request using the req object, 
and send a response using the res object. You can set response headers using res.writeHead() and send the response body using res.end().

HTTP Methods and Status Codes:
The HTTP module provides constants for common HTTP methods (e.g., http.METHODS) and status codes (e.g., http.STATUS_CODES),
which can be useful for building HTTP servers and handling requests.

Overall, the http module in Node.js provides a powerful and flexible API for working with the HTTP protocol, 
allowing you to build web servers, make HTTP requests, and interact with web services in your Node.js applications.
